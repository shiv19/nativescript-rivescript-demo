## Installation

```javascript
npm i

tns run android (or ios)
```

## Usage 

Just chat with that bot, using the chat box. 
(try sending "rpg demo", for something cool, but remember to send "exit" in the end
because same instance of the bot will be servered as long as username is same)
(also, if you see the bot is acting unusual, it's a good idea to send "exit" once)
